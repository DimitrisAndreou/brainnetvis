BrainNetVis is an application, written in Java, that displays and analyzes synchronization networks from brain signals. The program implements a number of network indices and visualization techniques. We demonstrate its use through a case study of motor imagery. The data sets were recorded from four healthy subjects and provided by the Berlin BCI group for  the Brain Computer Interface (BCI) competition IV.
